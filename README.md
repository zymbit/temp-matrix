# Temperature Matrix #

This is Arduino code for reading in a matrix of DS18B20 temperature sensors.
The code is written to read 4 sensors that have been connected to pin 2.  This
code has been tested with the Arduino Yun.

## Requirements ##

In order to compile this code you will need to download the [Arduino Library for Dallas Temperature ICs](https://github.com/milesburton/Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library).
